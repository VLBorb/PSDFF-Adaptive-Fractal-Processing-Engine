# PSDFF: Adaptive Fractal Processing Engine

**PSDFF (Processing System based on Fractal Frames)**, also referred to as the Enhanced Fractal System, is an innovative software-based approach to data processing that leverages fractal concepts, spectral resonance, and adaptive algorithms to enhance computational efficiency without relying solely on hardware upgrades[cite: 726, 736]. This project explores a paradigm where data is treated as "Bulk Logic Frames" (BLFs), encoded into frequency-like numeric signatures, and processed by a network of adaptive nodes[cite: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9].

The core idea is to create intelligent software that can self-organize, identify patterns, and process information in a highly parallelizable and emergent manner, with potential applications in AR/VR, AI, IoT, and real-time adaptive systems[cite: 755, 758, 761].

## ‚ú® Key Concepts & Innovations

* **Bulk Logic Frames (BLF):** Data is processed in large, synchronized frames rather than instruction-by-instruction[cite: 6, 152].
* **Spectral Resonance:** Binary flows are mapped to numeric "frequencies," and nodes activate based on their proximity (resonance) to these frequencies[cite: 7, 9, 153].
* **Adaptive Nodes:** Nodes can dynamically adjust their sensitivity (epsilon) to incoming data flows[cite: 393, 434, 614, 808].
* **Logic Combination:** Activated nodes combine resonant flows to produce new, emergent data flows with unique identities (hashes)[cite: 10, 11, 154, 730].
* **Fractal Memory:** An emergent storage system that indexes combined flows by their spectral signature and timestamp, allowing for pattern recognition through overlaps and recurrences[cite: 12, 13, 159, 731].
* **Node-to-Node Communication (Fractal Chaining):** Nodes can share their processed outputs with neighboring nodes, creating complex processing chains and enhancing logical throughput[cite: 396, 437, 541, 759, 810].
* **Parallel Processing:** The system is designed for parallelism, with node activations and flow combinations suitable for multi-threaded or GPU execution[cite: 42, 176, 435, 814].
* **Integrated Theoretical Model (FFPE):** Incorporates concepts like Fractal Priority (Œ¶), Adaptive Response (Œ®), and Emergent Fractal Velocity (VFE) to provide a theoretical basis for adaptivity[cite: 785, 815].

## üöÄ Core Features of the Latest Implementation

* **Adaptive Epsilon:** Node resonance thresholds dynamically adjust based on activity or per cycle[cite: 457, 458, 627].
* **Combination Caching:** Nodes cache the results of flow combinations to avoid redundant computations[cite: 395, 402, 469, 813].
* **Bounded Fractal Memory:** Fractal memory has a configurable maximum size, with a mechanism to discard older entries to manage resources[cite: 450, 463, 505, 669, 812].
* **Neighbor-Based Node Chaining:** Nodes communicate outputs to a defined set of neighbors (ring or random topology)[cite: 613, 636, 641, 642].
* **Parallel Execution:** Utilizes `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent node operations[cite: 466, 507, 635, 814].
* **Detailed Logging:** Captures node activation counts and memory usage per cycle for performance analysis[cite: 621, 622, 623, 624, 816].
* **Mini Demo & Visualization:** Includes a small test case with `matplotlib` for visualizing basic frequency processing[cite: 652, 654, 674, 676, 817].
